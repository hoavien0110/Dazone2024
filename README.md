## Business challenge round

### Problem: Personalize Viettel 4G package
In the digital age, the ability to connect to the internet anytime, anywhere has become an essential need for travelers. The Internet helps them work, entertain and stay connected seamlessly throughout their journey. To meet this need, Vietnam's tourism industry needs to prioritize providing personalized 4G packages suitable to each traveler's specific needs and schedule.

In Vietnam, Viettel is a leading telecommunications service provider with a nationwide coverage network, from remote islands to high mountain areas, ensuring signal availability throughout the length of the country. With the motto "No one is left behind", Viettel offers a variety of packages to meet customers' different internet needs.

Faced with the fact that the number of tourists coming to Vietnam is increasing, Viettel is trying to exploit this potential market segment. Specifically, the network operator personalizes 4G packages, ensuring service quality so that tourists can seamlessly access the internet, easily search for tourist destination information and connect with relatives.

Suppose you are a member of the project "Personalizing Viettel 4G package", you understand customers' internet usage habits, unique characteristics of tourist destinations and Viettel's ability to provide services in those areas.

Perform the classification problem (Classification) to predict suitable 4G packages for tourists based on information about their trip. From there, come up with appropriate campaigns to promote the packages.
